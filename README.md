# Meraki IOS

This is a clone of the legendary Cisco IOS command line adapted for use with the Meraki Dashboard API.  This emulates the IOS interpreter and passes commands directly to the API.  All you need is an API key and access to the internet.

The actual interpreter is still very much a work in progress.  No error handling to speak of yet.
